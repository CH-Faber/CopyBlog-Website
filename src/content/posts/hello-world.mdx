Welcome to your new blog, built by abstracting the VermilionVoid project. 

This template includes a variety of custom components and formatting options. Let's explore what you can do.

## Typography and Styling

Standard Markdown features like **bolding**, *italics*, and `inline code` work as expected. 

Lists are also supported:
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
- Third item

## Code Blocks

The template uses `astro-expressive-code` to render beautiful code blocks.

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

## Admonitions (Callouts)

You can use GitHub-style admonitions to highlight important information.

:::note
This is a helpful note. Use it for general information.
:::

:::tip
This is a tip. Great for sharing best practices or shortcuts.
:::

:::important
This is important information that the reader shouldn't miss.
:::

:::warning
Use a warning to alert the user of potential issues.
:::

:::caution
Caution should be used for actions that might have negative consequences.

## Math with KaTeX

You can write math equations using LaTeX syntax!

Inline math looks like this: $E = mc^2$.

Block math looks like this:

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
